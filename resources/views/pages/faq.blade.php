          A final project, commonly known as a dissertation on other degrees is probably one of the biggest pieces of work a student can do on a degree. You are more than likely currently working on your final project or starting soon if you are using Project Bazaar! The final year project is the culmination of the degree â€“ it gives students a chance to demonstrate all they have learned. The project module is very different from other modules. Although students are supervised, the onus is on the student to define the problem boundaries, to investigate possible solutions, and to present the results in writing, verbally and in action. Apart from an initial briefing session there are no formal lectures to attend. Teaching consists of regular individual/small group meetings to discuss progress. For assessment, students submit reports of their progress and final results, and give in-person presentations and demonstrations of their work.

          The project supervisor and not finding a suitable one can be an issue for a student before embarking on the project. Sazini, (2017) states that for a student to succeed in a project the supervisor is key. The best selective supervisor is the one that has a productive working relationship with the student. Making sure the supervisor is the best possible person to help with the particular project title. Their intimate knowledge of the topic itself and the academic field surrounding it will be indispensable throughout the duration of the project and writing process. Project supervision is an important aspect that influences the students experience with the final year project. Effective project supervision enables not only the student to complete the project but also enjoy the work (Pillai, 2011).

          The final project can be a very stressful time, it is important to remain calm and speak to any appropiate representative at the university. If you are feeling worried go and see your supervisor.
